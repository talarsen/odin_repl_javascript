Odin JavaScript Project
Here are some JS tasks that I completed throught the Odin Project using repl.it. 
  Some of the things that I learned in this section were
      mathematical operations in JS.
      if/ if else conditionals
      declaring variables
      concantenating variables and strings
      console.log()
